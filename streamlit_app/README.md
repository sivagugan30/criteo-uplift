# Uplift Modeling Dashboard

A Streamlit dashboard for analyzing uplift modeling results on the Criteo advertising dataset.

## Overview

This dashboard presents the results of uplift modeling analysis, designed for both business stakeholders and data science teams. It helps answer the question: "Who should we target with advertising to maximize ROI?"

## Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Home** | Executive summary with key metrics and navigation guide |
| **Campaign Overview** | Treatment effect analysis and overall campaign performance metrics |
| **Customer Segments** | Four customer types and recommended actions for each segment |
| **Model Performance** | Model comparison, Qini curves, and why T-Learner performs best |
| **Customer Lookup** | Search individual customers and understand their segment assignment |
| **ROI Calculator** | Interactive tool to simulate targeting strategies and expected returns |
| **Technical Details** | Methodology, model specifications, and statistical details for data science team |

## Local Development

1. Navigate to the streamlit app directory:
   ```bash
   cd streamlit_app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

## Deployment to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push this repository to GitHub

2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)

3. Connect your GitHub account

4. Select this repository and set:
   - Main file path: `streamlit_app/app.py`
   - Python version: 3.10 or higher

5. Click Deploy

## Data Requirements

The dashboard expects the following data files in `../visualizations/data/`:

- `nb01_*.csv` - EDA results
- `nb02_*.csv` - Model predictions and metrics
- `nb03_*.csv` - Causal forest analysis
- `nb04_*.csv` - Advanced evaluation
- `nb05_*.csv` - Customer segments and SHAP

These files are generated by running the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Key Findings

- **Best Model**: T-Learner with Qini coefficient of 35.2
- **Persuadables**: ~25% of customer base, 7x lift vs random targeting
- **Sleeping Dogs**: ~25% of customer base, negative treatment effect
- **Recommendation**: Target top 20-25% of customers for optimal ROI
